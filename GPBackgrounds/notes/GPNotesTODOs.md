 * Plots from the paper
  - chi squared  between two kernels and ad hoc function
  - Vary stats for chi-squared

* Error coverage
  - show error covers appropriate percentage of the time.

* Future studies
  - Background + signal fits. Compare doing the window cut and the global fit with hyperparameters tuned on MC
  - how hyperparameters change vs stats. when tuning on toys from AF2.
  - uncertainty covers choice of hyperparameter. Fix parameter at something we know is not optimal and check error coverage.

  - distribution of length scale for different stats
